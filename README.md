#HCNY Library System

HCNY has roughly 5,000 books. Most of them are religious books, written in English or Chinese. So far, the management of these books is not computerized. The borrow procedure is still very primitive, often leads to book lost. HCNYLS which stands for HCNY Library System is an online library system aiming at enabling the church to manage its books more efficiently by having features like categorizing and updating. It is also to help the church members to utilize the books more conveniently via online searching and ordering.
